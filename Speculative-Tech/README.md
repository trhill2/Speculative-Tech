Code Adapted from Complex State Machine by Scott Kidall

ComplexStateMachine for p5.js loads CSV tables in the constructor. Information loaded from the CSV tables and functions from sketch.js and clickable.js allow multiple states to be created. All come together to create a user-friendly, clickable experience of a complex state machine.
